We are a group of three boys from 4 A robotics who share a friendship with a boy who suffers from a degenerative disease, which prevents him from the main motor activities, such as the ability to walk or the difficulty in moving the upper limbs.

How to play the game:

The game is very simple, there is a boy who runs and he has to dodge the obstacles like bushes and pines. If the player hits the objects the game finishes. To control the game figure it's only necessary to own OpenPose, because we use a socket to reach the coordinates of the wirst and it transfer them in the code and move the avatar. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90908033/153711825-54ddcc97-06a3-4af1-9ef4-564a730c9d8c.png)

To start the game just open the file .bat, it opens OpenPose for first and then it opens the game.
To stop the game you have to click esc and appare a pause menu.

How it's made:

We use Unity programming environment, because it has a 3D part in wich we can prepare the scenes, with some object created in bleneder, a good application for 3D draw. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90908033/153711832-d9eefaeb-245c-4d5b-8cd7-1f7b808fcb36.png)
Unity gives the possibility to add some codes to control the objects in the game. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90908033/153711842-17fed2df-29d0-4bf6-a825-6e4793439e77.png)
Every object in the game have a RigidBody and a Collider, so they have physics as in reality, for a gameplay more similar to reality as possible.

To play this game is requied a nvidia graphic card and CUDA 10 dirver installed, for start the game you have to download the files, and excute the .bat file, it opens Open pose for first, after 5 seconds it opens the game.
