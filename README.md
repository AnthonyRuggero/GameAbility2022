We are a group of three boys from 4 A robotics who share a friendship with a boy who suffers from a degenerative disease, which prevents him from the main motor activities, such as the ability to walk or the difficulty in moving the upper limbs.

How to play the game:

The game is very simple, there is a boy who runs and he has to dodge the obstacles like bushes and pines. If the player hits the objects the game finishes. To control the game figure it's only necessary to own OpenPose, because we use a socket to reach the coordinates of the wirst and it transfer them in the code and move the avatar. OpenPoseFoto

How it's made:

We use Unity programming environment, because it has a 3D part in wich we can prepare the scenes, with some object created in bleneder, a good application for 3D draw. Blender. Unity give the possibility to add some codes to control the objects in the game. image
